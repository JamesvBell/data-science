# Conversion Rate A/B Testing Project Brief

## Objective
Build a comprehensive framework for analyzing conversion rate A/B tests using industry-standard statistical methods.

## Business Context
E-commerce checkout flow optimization - testing a simplified checkout process to increase conversion rates.

## Statistical Methods (Textbook Validated)
- **Primary Test**: Two-Proportion Z-Test (Agresti & Coull, 1998; recommended in "Statistical Methods" by Snedecor & Cochran)
- **Effect Size**: Relative lift and absolute difference
- **Confidence Intervals**: Wilson score intervals for proportions
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Bonferroni correction (conservative but widely accepted)

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand when to use proportion tests vs t-tests
2. Calculate statistical significance for binary outcomes
3. Interpret p-values and confidence intervals correctly
4. Handle segmentation and multiple testing
5. Communicate results to stakeholders

## Success Criteria
- Statistically sound methodology
- Reproducible analysis
- Clear stakeholder communication
- Code quality suitable for production
